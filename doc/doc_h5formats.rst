Changes in IEI h5 file format
=============================

The following is a brief overview of the various different hdf file formats that have come about from
different versions of the IceRadar Software for acquiring BlueSystem Radar data. 

These modifications have broken irlib code in the past but version 0.5 works-around these format differences. 

An easy way to examine the format of the h5 file you have is to look at it with an hdf viewer like vitables
or hdfview. 


Version 6.2 IceRadar (Mar 2022)  -- Not supported by irlib version 0.5
	An HDF format version number will be available. 
	Metadata tags used to have spaces within them.  This is now cleaned up.  
	For more changes see: https://iprdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/X.IceRadar_software/#file-attributes

Version 5.1 IceRadar (Sept 2016)

	Added correction for lat and lon such that the western and southern hemispheres are negative numbers
	Lat and Long are the field names and the values are floating point numbers

	PCSavetimestamp attributes contains the same string as before but the timestamp is before the 
	GPSCaptureEvent_StartBufferCapture.ms field. The format is dd/mm/yy_HH:MM:SS am/pm

Version 4.4.1 IceRadar: Format of PCSavetimestamp string is:

	With no GPS used: GPSCaptureEvent_StartBufferCapture.ms:-99,BufferCaptureTime.ms:264,PPS_NO
	With standard GPS reading: GPSCaptureEvent_StartBufferCapture.ms:72,BufferCaptureTime.ms:336,PPS_NO
	With PPS GPS reading: GPSCaptureEvent_StartBufferCapture.ms:72,BufferCaptureTime.ms:336,PPS_YES
    
	Importantly, in some cases the actual timestamp is saved as a comment field. The format is dd/mm/yyyy_HH:MM:SS am/pm 

Version ? IceRadar: (ca. 2009)

	lat and lon were both recorded as positive integers in fields Lat_N and Long_W. If either the lat and 
	lon are negative numbers, then irlib assumes that this paradigm is not in effect. 
	The user can use --swap_lon and --swap_lat to change the sign of either lat and lon in h5_dumpmeta.py, h5_add_utm.py and join_radar.py
		
	Computer time stored as PCSavetimestamp: mm/dd/yyyy_HH:MM:SS am/pm like "3/12/2014_11:49:20 AM" There are no
	GPSCapture stats.
	
Version ? IceRadar: (ca. 2008)	

	Computer time stored as "Save timestamp"
